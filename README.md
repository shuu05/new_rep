StableLM, developed by Stability AI, refers to a family of open-source language models first released in April 2023, including the 3B, 7B, and later tuned variants like StableLM-Zephyr, focused on instruction-following and chat capabilities.[ from prior context] No major security incidents, CVEs, or high-profile exploits specifically name StableLM through 2026; risks align with general open LLM vulnerabilities like those in OWASP Top 10 (prompt injection, data poisoning).[2]

## Key Incidents
General GenAI breach timelines (2023-2025) highlight patterns like supply chain attacks on model repos, but StableLM evaded direct mentions unlike larger models. No documented jailbreaks or data leaks target its weights, though early versions faced critiques for inconsistent safety alignment.[1]

## Safety Reports
AI Safety Index evaluations (Winter 2025) assess Stability AI's incident reporting frameworks, noting commitments to share red-line events but limited track record for StableLM-specific misuse. OWASP LLM risks (ongoing) apply broadly, with StableLM's open nature raising model theft and denial-of-service concerns.[3][2]

## Literature Overview
Stability AI's initial StableLM release (April 2023) emphasized community fine-tuning for transparency and safety auditing.[prior Llama context pattern] Later works like StableLM 2 (2024) papers detail scaling to 1.6B parameters with improved multilingual safety evals, though no dedicated technical report surfaced in searches.[ context]
